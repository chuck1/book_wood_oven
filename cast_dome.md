# Cast Dome

There are two ways to build a cast dome: cast-in-place or prefabricated.

## Cast-In-Place

With cast-in-place, you build forms and then pour the dome directly on your oven floor.
You building a form which fills the inner volume of your oven.
You also need some forms around the outside.

## Prefabricated

You can buy prefabricated domes.
These can come are a single piece or in several pieces.

You can also make your own prefabircated dome.

### Segments

You can divide the dome into equal slices like a pie.
For example if you divide the dome into ten pieces, each piece will cover 36 degrees of the circle of the dome.

I had some trouble with concrete adhering to the form.
I have made the curved inner surface of the form out of styrofoam.
I then covered the styrofoam in drywall compound so that I could get a smooth sandable surface.
I then painted the inside of the form with laquer paint, thinking that this would make the concrete come out easier.
It was then that I learned that certain paints disolve styrofoam.
I also sprayed cooking spray liberally all over the inside of the form before each pour.

My two test pieces came out very easily.
But when I went to take out the first piece with refractory concrete, it would not separate from the form with just tapping with a hammer.
I had to drive chisels in between the piece and form at the top and bottom to pry it out.
Once out, I found that large sections of the drywall compound had been pulled out with the piece.
I then had the idea to line the inner surface of the form with kitchen plastic wrap.
