## Center Chimney

In this section I will describe the solution I have chosen for my first oven.

The chimney will be place at the top center of the oven.
The vent will be located in the door as usual.
A passage will be built to take the exhaust from the vent to the chimney.

I passage will consist of three parts. First is a transition from the vent to the second part of the passage.
Since it needs to be a complicated shape, I'm thinking of creating a sand mold in place and casting it.

The second part is a straight passage along the dome towards the top.
My plan is to get a section of steel stove pipe, cut it lengthwise and bend it into a semi-circular shape.
I will need to create relief cuts in order to follow the curvature of the dome.
The metal will be mortared in place.

The last part will be a precast cylindrical base made from refractory cement.
I am planning on pruchasing a clay chimney.
The base will designed to mate with the bottom of the chimney.
The base will sit directly on the top of the dome.
A hole will be cut out of the base to allow exhaust from the second part enter.
Steam vents can be drilled into this part where it is adjacent to the fiber blanket insulation.
