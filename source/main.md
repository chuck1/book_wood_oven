# Introduction

This document is meant to provide instructions and advice on the construction of a particular style of wood-fired oven.
It is meant to be very detailed as to be useful for someone with little construction experience.
Much of the materials was taken from the [Forno Bravo Oven Plans](https://www.fornobravo.com/pompeii-oven/pompeii-oven-plans/).

If this quide does not answer a question you have, please [create an issue](https://github.com/chuck1/book_wood_oven/issues) on the github page.
If you want to contribute to this document, see instruction in the [README](https://github.com/chuck1/book_wood_oven).

## General Advice

Do lots of research up front.
Develop very detailed designs of your oven.
Read through the forums and this document thoroughly.
Gather all materials (or at least get final quotes for) before you break ground.
When buying materials that you havent worked with before, make sure what you're buying is the right material for the job
and make sure you know how to use it.
Get sample and practice if you have to.
Dont forget how much financial and time investment this oven will be, you do not want to have to try to repair it once its built,
that will be expensive, time conduming and difficult.
So take your time, do your research.
Be confident that each part of your oven will work as intended.
This document will hopefully answer alot of questions you will have.

Do your research and be patient.
Building the oven is a long process, if you're like me you may get impatient.
There are alot of parts and alot of ways to make mistakes.
Take your time and do it right.

### Tools

Consider buying a concrete mixer.
If you can justify the cost (as opposed to renting), you will not regret having it.

Consider buying a concrete vibrator.
If you can get a cheap one for under $100, it is well worth being able to easily get good pours.
This especially applies if you are casting your dome.

# Overall design

## Ash Chute

Some people create a narrow gap somewhere between the floor of the door and oven.
Ash is swept into this gap and falls into a container.
