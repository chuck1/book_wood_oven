What is curing and why must we do it?
Curing is slowly increasing the temperature of the oven to gently drive moisture out of the concrete, bricks, and mortar.
If the temperature were increased too quickly, the water would turn to steam inside these materials, causing cracks.

It is important to apply your dome insulation before starting curing fires in order to get a more even temperature inside these materials.

The FB instructions say to build progressively hotter curing fires; 300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 F.

_where is this temperature measured?_

They say to maintain each for for at least 6 hours or up to 16 hours.
I assume that longer than 16 hours is not necessary.

You can build these fires in the center of the oven using the same type of wood that would be used to cook with.
However, I see no reason you couldnt also use pine or even untreated lumber.
Just consider what you are putting in your oven and what fumes it will produce and what byproducts it will leave behind.

Some people use charcoal briquettes arranged in a ring along the edge of the dome.
