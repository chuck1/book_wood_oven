# Foundation

The foundation is a reinforced concrete slab.
It must support the weight of the stand, hearth and oven which together can weight several thousand kilograms.

When planning your foundation, you need to think about the type of soil and the climate you live in.

FB recommends a minimum thickness of 14 cm.

The dimensions of the slab should be 20 cm greater than the dimensions of the stand.
This leaves room for a finish on the stand and reveal.
This extra will also be used to support forms for pouring the hearth.
The top of the slab should be 5-8 cm above ground level.

If you are planning other project that will require a slab such as an outdoor kitchen or patio, consider pouring
them at the same time.
