# Dome Finish - Tile

It seems that the overall idea is:

* Dome. bricks or castable
* Fiber blanket insulation
* Chicken wire. To give the next layer something to grab on to
* a rigid layer
    * Could be stucco or some type of concrete.
    * Required because the blanket is compressible and you want a rigid surface on which to lay tile.
* Waterproofing
    * There are many options. Many are thin liquid coatings that are painted on.
* Mortar
    * I have seen suggestions for using Flexbond by Custom. This is a high quality, polymer mortar.
* Tiles
* Grout. Just normal grout?
* Waterproofer for grout?
