## Recessed Hearth

In a recessed hearth, a void is created in the concrete.
This is where the floor insulation and brick will sit.
The purpose of a recessed hearth is to make the perimenter concrete flush with the floor of the oven.

A gap of about 1/4 inch should be left between the floor and concrete for the floor to expand as it heats up.
It would also be wise to have insulation between the floor bricks and the perimeter concrete.

Getting the floor to be level and level with the perimenter concrete was fairly difficult.
And after hours carefully spreading sand, my floor did not come out as perfect as I would hope.
Therefore, if I build an oven like this again, I will look into concrete leveler.
Concrete leveler comes as a powder that is mixed with water.
I forms a thin mix that can be poured and naturally levels using gravity.
I want to see is this could be used on both the top of the concrete perimeter to get it perfectly level
and also on the center of the hearth.
Then you would have two surfaces that are perfectly level.
And possibly, you could use adjust the thickness of level used on each of the surfaces to get the height difference perfect for your
floor insulation and brick.
If it works as I'm imagining, you could get a perfectly level cooking floor that matches perfectly to
the perimeter concrete with alot less hassle.
For me, this would have been well worth the high price of concrete leveler.
And if you dont want to have the concrete leveler be the finished surface on the perimeter, you can cover it with tile, grantite, or whatever you want;
you just have to account for this in the height difference between the surfaces.
