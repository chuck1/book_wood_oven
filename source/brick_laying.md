## Brick Laying

Submerge you bricks in water before laying them.
The bricks will absorb some water.
If you dont do this, the bricks will absorb water from the mortar when they are laid
which will weaken the mortar.

If you have never laid brick before, I suggest getting some regular mortar and clay bricks
and practicing until you feel comfortable.
You want you brickwork to look good.
