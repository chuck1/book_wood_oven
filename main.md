It is meant to be very detailed as to be useful for someone with little construction experience.

## General Advice

Do lots of research up front.
Develop very detailed designs of your oven.
Read through the forums and this document thoroughly.
Gather all materials (or at least get final quotes for) before you break ground.
When buying materials that you havent worked with before, make sure what you're buying is the right material for the job
and make sure you know how to use it.
Get sample and practice if you have to.
Dont forget how much financial and time investment this oven will be, you do not want to have to try to repair it once its built,
that will be expensive, time conduming and difficult.
So take your time, do your research.
Be confident that each part of your oven will work as intended.
This document will hopefully answer alot of questions you will have.

### Tools

Consider buying a concrete mixer.
If you can justify the cost (as opposed to renting), you will not regret having it.

Consider buying a concrete vibrator.
If you can get a cheap one for under $100, it is well worth being able to easily get good pours.
This especially applies if you are casting your dome.


# Overall design

## Ash Chute

Some people create a narrow gap somewhere between the floor of the door and oven.
Ash is swept into this gap and falls into a container.

# Planning

# Foundation

When planning your foundation, you need to think about the type of soil and the climate you live in.

You can also think about ground pressure, but I dont know if this is necessary.
To calculate ground pressure, take the total weight of your oven including the foundation and divide that by the area of your foundation.
This is the ground pressure.

# Stand

The purpose of the stand is to lift the oven up off the ground to a comfortable height for cooking.
The easiest and cheapest way to build your stand is using cinder blocks.
