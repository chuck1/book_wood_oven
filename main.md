# Foundation

When planning your foundation, you need to think about the type of soil and the climate you live in.

You can also think about ground pressure.
To calculate ground pressure, take the total weight of your oven including the foundation and divide that by the area of your foundation.
This is the ground pressure.


# Stand

The purpose of the stand is to lift the oven up off the ground to a comfortable height for cooking.
The easiest and cheapest way to build your stand is using cinder blocks.
