# Dome

There are two basic shapes of domes.

A hemispherical is self-explanatory.
The get technical, it has a height equal to its readius and the curvature as you move up the dome is constant.

The other I dont know the name for, so I'll call it a low dome.
A low dome has a height lower than its radius.
The curvature changes as you move up the dome.
One way to design a low dome is to start with straight side at the base of the dome.
Then transition to a constant curvature up to the top of the dome.

One concern with a low dome is that the dome is not perfectly self-supporting as the hemispherical dome is.
I had the idea to ad extra support near the bottom of the dome.
And I found one exmaple of someone else doing this [here](https://aleksandr-ta.livejournal.com/?skip=10).
